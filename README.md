To try this out with a differet blog, just edit the BASE_URL and QUERY values in PARAMS.py. 

This code is meant to be neither complete, nor exhaustive. However it is meant to be informative and explanatory. 

Feel free to try it out, use this code in any applications you like, and always reach out with any questions or feedback!
